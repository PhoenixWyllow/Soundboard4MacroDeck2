# Contributing Languages 

This plugin has its own localization files, independent of Macro Deck.
These are in a json format and are parsed at application load.

If your language is not available, the plugin will default to English.
***
### If your language is missing or incomplete, please consider helping me out!

To contribute your language, join the project on https://poeditor.com/join/project?hash=T6WOz3ECo7 and contribute your translation.

It's as simple as that! I will do the merging from there!

**You should be notified via email if I add new phrases, but be sure to check back in case!**
